This project depends on Caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). To use the Matlab version of the code, run "make all matcaffe" in Caffe root; to use the Python version, run "make all pycaffe" in Caffe root.

Support vector machine code depends on scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

constants.py contains root of Caffe and images and source code of the project. Change the values to correct paths.

alexnet_feature_extract.ipynb: Python code for visualizing responses and weights

shrink-images.py: Shrink all images in a directory to smaller images with white padding
	- First argument: path to directory
	- fraction argument: how many times smaller the new image should be

svm.py: Support vector machine code to classify responses of AlexNet.
	- type1 argument: path to directory containing images of type 1
	- type2 argument: path to directory containing images of type 2
	- others argument: path to directory containing images of all other types
