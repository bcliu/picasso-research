raising questions that people ignore, thinking about why, experiment and try -- that's the cool part!!! thanks to taising, this is an interesting question -- you though CNN is good enough, but why it can't recognize those cubism paintings???

Caffe fine tuning: does it mean more classes in last fully connected layer, more neurons???

Unable to find which combinations of neurons on 5th conv layer codes eyes -- how about use another NN to find such combinations??

WHY SHRINKING IMAGES OF EYES AND NOSES: WHEN LARGE, (EVEN JUST OCCUPY 1/4 OF IMAGE) STILL CLASSIFICATION RESULT IS KINDA RANDOM. HAVE TO BE SMALL!
BACKGROUND IMAGE DOESN'T SEEM TO DISTURB MUCH
